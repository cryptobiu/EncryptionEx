**Encryption Exercise**

The repository contains python script that implements encryption (badly) for the purpose of carrying out an attack.

There are two tasks:
1) There is a given ciphertext in the repository. The first task is to find the plaintext (without looking at the key file).
2) The second task is to find the key itself. In order to do this, you are only allowed to use the encrypt function (with any plaintext you like), and the decrypt_check function.
