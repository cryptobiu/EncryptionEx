**Encryption Exercise**

The repository contains python script that implements encryption (badly) for the purpose of carrying out an attack. This method of encrypting was actually recommended in a Microsoft help document (that was quickly removed after it was discovered). The original help document appears as PDF in the repository. 

There are four tasks:
1) There is a given ciphertext in the repository. The first task is to find the plaintext (without looking at the key file).
2) The second task is to find the key itself. In order to do this, you are only allowed to use the encrypt function (with any plaintext you like), and the decrypt_check function.
3) The third task is to review the PDF document and describe all of the errors within.
4) The fourth task is the most challenging, and is to carry out tasks (1) and (2) using the encrypt and decrypt_process functions only.
